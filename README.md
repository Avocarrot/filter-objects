## Installation

```npm install filter-objects```

## Usage

- ```filter(arr, filters, operator)```

Returns an array of all the objects in `arr` that satisfy the `filters`. `operator` can take two values `every` or 'some'. If 'every' is used then the returned objects satisfy *every* filter or alternatively if 'some' is used then the returned objects satisfy at least one of the filters.

### Examples

```javascript
  const filters = [
    {
      field: 'foo',
      value: 1,
      operator: 'equals'
    },
    {
      field: 'bar',
      value: 'baz',
      operator: 'equals'
    }
  ];

  const arr = [
    {
      foo: 1,
      bar: 'baz'
    },
    {
      foo: 2,
      bar: 'baz'
    },
    {
      foo: 3,
      bar: 'fiz'
    }
  ];

  let res = filter(arr, filters, 'every');
```
