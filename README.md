[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/query-objects.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/query-objects/)

## Purpose

A utility library which filters objects from an array of objects based on a set of filter conditions.

```javascript
  const query = require('query-objects');

  const users = [
    {
      firstName: 'George',
      lastName: 'Eracleous',
      age: 28
    },
    {
      firstName: 'Erica',
      lastName: 'Archer',
      age: 50
    },
    {
      firstName: 'Leo',
      lastName: 'Andrews',
      age: 20
    }
  ];

  const filters = [
    {
      field: 'age',
      value: 30,
      operator: 'lt'
    },
    {
      field: 'firstName',
      value: 'Erica',
      operator: 'equals'
    }
  ];

  // Filter all users that are less than 30 years old AND their first name is Erica
  const res = query(users).every(filters);

  // Filter all users that are less than 30 years old OR their first name is Erica
  const res = query(users).some(filters);

```

## Installation

```npm install filter-objects```

## Usage

1. Create a query object by using `query(arr)` where `arr` is the array of objects you want to query.

```javascript
const q = query(arr)
```

2. Finally get the result array using:

```javascript
q.every(filters); //returns an array of all objects in `arr` that satisfy EVERY filter

q.some(filters); //returns an array of all objects in `arr` that satisfy SOME of the filters
```

## Filters

`field` - The name of the property we will filter on

`value` - The value of the property we will filter on

`operator` - The filter operator. Supported operators `equals`, `contains`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `ne`
